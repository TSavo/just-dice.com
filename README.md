just-dice.com Enhancement Suite
========================

This is a chrome extension that provides various enhancements to just-dice.com. Specifically, creates the ability to use the [martingale betting strategy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_(betting_system\)) directly from the browser.

THIS IS ALPHA ALPHA SOFTWARE. PLEASE REVIEW THE CODE AND DO NOT HAVE MORE THAN YOU ARE WILLING TO LOSE AS YOUR BALANCE.

How to Bet
----------
Remember this is alpha alpha software and there should not be any more coins in your account than you are willing to lose.

The `Multiplier` box contains the number your bet will be multiplied by 
The `Steps` box contains the number of iterations the betting strategy will use until either a) a win is accomplished; or b) the number of steps is exceeded.

The chrome extension uses the `bet size` to make the initial bet.

If martingale extension will not allow you to place a bet constructed such that the Multiplier, Steps, and Bet Size would exceed your available balance.

If an input box does not have focus you are able to use the 'r' key to run the martingale strategy.

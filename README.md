just-dice.com Enhancement Suite
========================

This is a chrome extension that provides various enhancements to just-dice.com. Specifically, creates the ability to use the [martingale betting strategy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_(betting_system\)) directly from the browser.

THIS IS ALPHA ALPHA SOFTWARE. PLEASE REVIEW THE CODE AND DO NOT HAVE MORE THAN YOU ARE WILLING TO LOSE AS YOUR BALANCE.

THIS REPO IS A BLEEDING EDGE REPO. INSTALL AT YOUR OWN RISK. THE VERSION ON THE GOOGLE CHROME STORE IS STABLE.

How to Bet
----------
Remember this is alpha alpha software and there should not be any more coins in your account than you are willing to lose.

The `Multiplier` box contains the number your bet will be multiplied by 
The `Steps` box contains the number of iterations the betting strategy will use until either a) a win is accomplished; or b) the number of steps is exceeded.

The chrome extension uses the `bet size` to make the initial bet.
